# Work in progress

Convert a SVG file in a VDS file ready to use with VStudio for Valiani digital flatbed plotters.

Currently this is the minimum functional converter: it applies transformations, flatten curves into straight lines and create the final VDS file.

Eventually it will allow to choose cut and utensile type for every path and will be optimized.
